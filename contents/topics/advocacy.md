**The Advocacy of the Son and the Holy Spirit**

**adapted from the teaching of Pastor R. B. Thieme, Jr., Berachah
Church, Houston, Texas**

The believer continues to sin after salvation, 1 John 1:8,10.

Satan accumulates a sin file on every believer and periodically accuses
the believer in heaven. The information is collected through demons, Job
1:6-11; Zechariah 3:1-2; Revelation 12:9-10.

Jesus Christ is retained as the believer’s defense attorney (Advocate)
in the court of heaven and He defends every case. Occasionally, some
believer is turned over to Satan for the administration of the sin unto
death.

The basis for our Lord’s defense is the fact that all our sins were
judged at the cross in Him by God the Father, 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1
Peter 2:24.

God the Father judged our sins on the cross, Psalm 22:1-6; 1 Peter 3:18.

Under the law of double jeopardy, those sins cannot be judged again,
Romans 6:10.

Therefore the believer is defended in heaven from Satan.

Hence, every case is thrown out of court by God the Father, Zechariah
3:1-2.

The sins of the believer then become not a court matter but a family
matter for the imputation of divine discipline, Hebrews 12:6.

An advocate is one who undertakes the cause of another. In its Biblical
meaning, advocacy represents divine enablement and assistance.

The New Testament word for advocate is PARAKLETOS, John 14:16,26;
15:26; 16:17.

Two persons of the Trinity are recognized as advocates: the Son and the
Spirit. Christ in His earthly ministry was an advocate for His own in
the world; before He left He promised another to come. By the use of the
word “another,” Christ implied that His own ministry on earth had been
that of an advocate, John 14:16.

As a legal representative in the court of heaven, Christ now functions
as the believer’s advocate, 1 John 2:1.

This present work of Christ is known as the “unfinished work.”

The advocacy of Christ in heaven regarding the believer’s sin is so
complete and perfect that He has the title “Jesus Christ the righteous.”

The advocacy of the Spirit is one of intercession and direct aiding,
Romans 8:26-27.

Thus, there are three general uses of the word “advocate”:

1.  A legal advocate, which Christ is now in heaven;

2.  An intercession agent, which Christ and the Spirit are now;

3.  A general helper, which Christ was while on earth and which the
    Spirit is throughout the Church Age.
