It is remarkable that two men called Sergius Paulus are described in
very similar terms by two physicians who wrote in Greek, the one a
heathen, the other a Christian.

The heathen writer is Galen. He speaks of his contemporary as a man
interested and well versed in philosophy.

The Christian writer is St. Luke, who tells us here that the governor of
Cyprus was a “prudent” man, who “desired to hear the Word of God.” This
governor seems to have been of a candid and inquiring mind; nor will
this philosophical disposition be thought inconsistent with his
connection with the Jewish imposter, whom Saul and Barnabas found at the
Paphian court, by those who are acquainted with the intellectual and
religious tendencies of the age.

For many years before this time, and many years after, impostors from
the East, pretending to magical powers, had great influence over the
Roman mind. All the Greek and Latin literature of the empire, from
Horace to Lucian, abounds in proof of the prevalent credulity of this
skeptical period. Unbelief, when it has become conscious of its
weakness, is often glad to give its hand to superstition. The faith of
educated Romans was utterly gone. We can hardly wonder, when the East
was thrown open – the land of mystery, the fountain of the earliest
migrations, the cradle of the earliest religions – that the imagination
both of the populace and the aristocracy of Rome became fanatically
excited, and that they greedily welcomed the most absurd and degrading
superstitions. Not only was the metropolis of the empire crowded with
“hungry Greeks” but “Syrian fortune tellers” flocked into all the haunts
of public amusement. Athens and Corinth did not now contribute the
greatest or the worst part of the dregs of Rome; but (to adopt Juvenal’s
use of that river of Antioch we have lately been describing) “the
Orontes itself flowed into the Tiber.”
