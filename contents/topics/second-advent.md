The word ‘second’ indicates that there are two advents. The first was at
the birth of the only-begotten Son of God, and the objective of the
first advent was to provide salvation for all mankind. The second advent
will display the Royalty and Glory of our Lord, and at that time He will
fulfill all the covenants to Israel.

The Rapture is NOT the second Advent. At the Rapture of the Church,
Christ does not actually touch the earth. We, the Church Age believers,
meet Him in the air. Whereas the Second Advent is the return of our Lord
to the earth in His hypostatic union.

The Rapture is designated as private, Acts 1:11; i.e., it is for the
Church only, for believers only. Whereas the Second Advent is public,
Rev. 1:7. Every eye shall see him.

The Rapture occurs in the air, I Thess. 4:17; the Second Advent occurs
on the earth. And the Church goes up to heaven at the Rapture, John
14:3; whereas at the Second Advent, the Church returns with Christ, I
Thess. 3:13.

Additionally, the Rapture includes the judgment of the believer’s works,
II Cor. 5:10; whereas the Second Advent includes many judgments, Matthew
25:31-46.

At the Rapture, the restraining ministry of God the Holy Spirit is
removed, II Thess. 2:6; whereas at the Second Advent, Satan is removed,
Rev. 20:1-3. And the Rapture causes a change in the believer’s body,
Philippians 3:21; whereas the Second Advent causes a change in the
earth, Zechariah 14:9 and Romans 8:19-27.

At the Rapture of the Church, Christ appears as the Groom, while at the
Second Advent Christ appears as the Messiah to Israel and as Royalty to
the whole earth (King of Kings and Lord of Lords).

The Rapture signals the end of the Church Age, while the Second Advent
signals the end of the Jewish Age. Too, at the time of the Rapture,
Israel is dispersed; while at the Second Advent, Israel will be restored
and regathered.

At the Rapture believers are taken from the earth, I Thess. 4:16-18;
whereas at the Second Advent, unbelievers are taken from the earth,
Matthew 24:37-43. And the Rapture is a source of comfort to the
believer, I Thess. 4:18, while the Second Advent is a source of terror
to the unbeliever, Rev. 6:15-17.

And according to Zechariah 14:1-4 the location of the Second Advent is
Jerusalem. There are two analogies to the Second Advent utilized in the
Bible:

1. Lightning, Matthew 24:27.

2. Historical, Matthew 24:37-41 (ignorance).

It is at the Second Advent that Christ is totally victorious over Satan.
In Scripture the phraseology is “he will be as your footstool.” Psalm
110:1, Hebrews 11:13; 10:13. Also at this time, our Lord’s Bride will be
cleansed from all except divine good, I Cor. 3:12,15. Satan will be
imprisoned, Rev. 20:1-3. The triumphal procession of Christ will occur,
Col. 2:15. And believers will cast demons into the Lake of Fire, Zech.
13:2 cf. Col. 2:15 cf. I Cor. 15:24-25.

Too, at the Second Advent the Baptism of Fire occurs, I Thess. 1:7-9;
Matt. 3:11-12.

And this Baptism of Fire vindicates the perfect character of God.

The Second Advent ushers in the Millennium during which there will be
perfect environment and free will. Isa. 65:24, Joel 2:28,29; Zech.
8:20-23; Dan. 9:24; Psalm 46:9, 72:7,16, Isa. 11:3-5; Romans 8:19-22,
Isa. 11:6-9, 65:25.
