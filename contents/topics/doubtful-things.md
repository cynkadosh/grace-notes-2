The doctrine of **Doubtful Things** refers to those issues that are not
directly dealt with in the Scriptures. It is primarily related to a
believer’s attitude toward the weaker Christian.

R. B. Thieme draws a distinction between sin and doubtful things. In so
doing he selects Proverbs 6:16-19 to describe the primary areas of sin
with which God is concerned. He observes that many believers think only
in terms of a few taboos, and that they are scarcely aware of the
existence of extremely damaging sins in their own lives. Taboos are
certain practices commonly condemned by many Christians, but not
specifically condemned in the Scriptures. Among these, Thieme lists what
he calls “the ‘big five’ – don’t drink, don’t dance, don’t smoke, don’t
go to shows and don’t wear make-up!” He claims that many people “judge
everybody on the basis of the taboos, yet they themselves are habitually
committing sin after sin.”

From a study of James 2 and 1 Corinthians 8-10, Thieme draws three
principles or laws governing ones response to doubtful things.

The first principle is the **law of liberty**. This means that
“biblically speaking, I have the right to do certain things. There are
certain things that I can do that will not hurt me, nor will they
disturb my spiritual equilibrium.”

The second principle is the **law of love**. Thieme’s introductory
statement of this principle summarizes well his exposition of 1
Corinthians 8:

The law of love takes other believers into consideration. In effect,
this law says that because of my love for the weaker and often
legalistic brethren, and in order to keep them from being highly
critical or upset and disturbed, there are certain things which I have
the liberty to do, yet I will refrain from doing them – not because they
are wrong in themselves, but because as a believer advanced in doctrine
I want to help other believers rather than hinder them.

Based upon 1 Corinthians 10:23, Thieme draws the third principle: **the
law of expediency**. This law is primarily directed toward the
unbeliever. A Christian may have to make decisions in the area of
doubtful things in order to maintain a testimony in his life before the
unbelieving world.

In summary, the law of liberty applies to the mature believer who,
because of knowledge, understands that “aside from immorality, all
things are lawful.” This law, however, is superseded by the higher law,
“the law of love” in many cases, and it is superseded by the “law of
expediency” in other situations.
