##Islam
####A synopsis of Muslim beliefs

The word "Islam" in the Arabic language means "submission" and "peace".

A Muslim, therefore, is a person who submits to the will of Allah and thereby finds peace. The name Islam is derived from the Arabic word "salaam" meaning peace.

Who are the Muslims? The common answer is "the Arabs." This is a mistaken impression that is true only insofar as Islam arose among the Arabs, its Prophet and many of its adherents were and are Arabs, and its scripture, the Holy Quran, must be recited in original Arabic form. 

Only about 25% of the present population of Islam are Arabs. Muslims form the majority of the population in roughly thirty-six (36) countries and nearly half of the population in five others. 

The estimated strength of Islam is estimated to be one billion people, almost one fifth of world population. Islam is the world's third largest religion, behind Christianity and Buddhism, and its present rate of growth and vitality rivals both traditions.

Muslims represent many races and socio-economic groups. And there have been significant divisions of opinion within the umma (commonwealth of Islam, or Islamic Community). Despite these differences, Muslims strives to bring unity by incorporating divergent interpretations of basic beliefs.

###Sunni

The recorded practice and teachings of the prophet Mohammad were early regarded as his Sunnah, meaning “path” or “way”. These traditions became powerful symbols for the Islamic religion, models of right belief and practice. 

The collection of the prophet Mohammad's sayings are called "Hadith", comprising Sunnah or "authoritative examples." These have required further interpretations and application to a variety of situations of everyday life.

The majority of Muslims following the Sunnah of Prophet Mohammad are termed "Sunnis." 

Islam developed four schools of jurisprudence (law) whose functions were to decide upon the proper application of Holy Quran and Sunnah to virtually all aspects of life of the community. Each of the four schools takes its name from early jurist to whom later followers trace many of the school's distinctive opinions. The four schools are:

1.	**Hanifi's** (after Abu Hanifa, died 767)
2.	**Maliki's** (after Malik ibn Anas, died 795)
3.	**Shafi'is** (after Muhammad al-Shafi'i, died 819)
4.	**Hanbali's** (after Ahmad ibn Hanbal, died 855)

The learned scholars of law are called Ulema. They are highly respected for their learning in the religious sciences. Islam has no clergy or priesthood as such. 

The basic principles of Islamic Law are established by the following:

1.	The Holy Quran
2.	The Prophet's Sunnah
3.	The learned consensus of Ulema
4.	Reasoning by analogy from accepted interpretations of 1 and 2 to new problems not directly addressed therein.

All of the four above form a concept of revelation of God's will to the community of Islam. This concept is called Shari'a. 

Shari’a is more than scripture, it is a composite source of teaching and practice involving the Holy Quran, the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad and authoritative human interpretation and application.

###Shi’ia

The Shi’ia are the most significant minority of Muslims, perhaps comprising 10% to 15 % of the Muslim population.

They differ on certain religious and political matters almost since the beginning of Islam. They are known as Shi'ia 's. The historical and religious differences do not obscure the broad lines of agreement between Shi'ias and Sunnis.

Shi'ias differ little from Sunnis in belief and practice. Their differences lie mainly in the modes of leadership and piety. Although Islam united the Arabs of North and South under the same banner, the cultural and traditional differences remained strong and surfaced at the time when Muslims were choosing the successors of Prophet Muhammad after His death. 

The majority (including Sunnis) believed in choosing from the closest companions of Prophet Muhammad while others (including Shi’ias) sought guidance in political and religious matters from Hazart Ali, Prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law. 

Hazart Ali was chosen as the fourth Caliph (leader of Islamic community) but was assassinated in 661. The civil strife that resulted left and indelible mark upon the Islamic Umma (community).

Shi'ias believe that the Prophet Muhammad passed on a significant part of his teachings directly to Hazart Ali, and thence to subsequent Imams (spiritual leaders). Although the twelfth and last Imam disappeared late in the ninth century, he is expected to return before the Judgement Day. 

The Shia Ulema carry on the distinctive teachings and interpretations they trace back through the Imams to Prophet Muhammad. The teachings of the sixth Imam, Jafar al-Sadiq (died 765) became the basis of Jafari schools among Sunnis.

The emotional intensity that characterizes Shi'ia beliefs culminates on the tenth day of Muharram (the first month of Islamic calendar). On this date in Karbala, Iraq, in 680, Hazart Hussain, son of Hazart Ali and grandson of Prophet Muhammad, was brutally murdered by troops of Ummayyad Caliph Yazid. For nine days, Yazid's troops besieged the camps and deprived Hazart Hussain and his followers (72 of them) of any water. Remembering the tragedy of Hazart Hussain on every year on 10th of Muharram is done by Sunnis as well as Shi'ias.

###The Five Pillars of Islam

The pillars of Islam are considered obligatory practice for all Muslims, although Sunni and Shia schools of law have slight variations.

The pillars of Islam play important roles in intellectual and social dimensions of Islamic life. The five pillars of faith and practice are:

1.	**Shahada** (Witness)
2.	**Salat** (Prayer)
3.	**Zakat** (Alms)
4.	**Sawm** or **Siyam** (Fasting)
5.	**Hajj** (Pilgrimage)

###SHAHADA: (Witness) 

The Shahada is, in Arabic "La ilah ha il Allah, Muhammadan Rasul-Allah" 

Translation: "(There is) No deity but Allah (and) Muhammad is His Messenger (or Prophet)" 

or, "There is no God but Allah; Muhammad is His Apostle"

Islam is one of the three monotheistic religions to arise in the Middle East; along with Judaism and Christianity.

Islam stresses the oneness and uniqueness of God. The word 'Allah' means 'The God.'

The second phrase of the Shahada declares that Muhammad is God's messenger to humankind. While accepting the Judeo-Christian Biblical tradition in large part, Muslims believe that God had sent prophets and messengers to other nations in the past with the same revealed message Muhammad was to recite to the Arabs. Muhammad's mission brought the final revelation of divine Truth; thus Muhammad is regarded as the "Seal of the Prophets."

###SALAT: (Prayer) 

Performing daily prayers is an act of communication between man and God. Five daily prayers are considered a duty for all Muslims; on these occasions, certain preparations in ritual purity are required. 

The prayers are 

**Fajr** (early morning before the sunrise)

**Zuhr** (afternoon)

**Asr** (later afternoon)

**Maghrib** (after sunset) and 

**Isha** (evening). 

These prayers must be said while facing in the direction of Mecca. The congregational prayer of Friday afternoon is compulsory and must be said in a Mosque, Muslim's place of worship. In these services, there is a sermon and then the prayers in uniform rows.

###ZAKAT: (Alms) 

The Zakat is a means of providing for those who are less fortunate. It is obligatory upon all Muslims to give 2.5 % of wealth and assets each year (in excess of what is required) to the poor. This is done before the beginning of the month of Muharram, the first of new year. Giving the Zakat is considered an act of worship because it is a means of offering thanks to God for the wealth, property, and well-being one has acquired.

###SAWM or SIYAM: (FASTING)

Another form of offering thanks to God is fasting. It is duty to all Muslims to fast during the ninth month of Islamic calendar, Ramadan. 

During Ramadan, Muslims refrain from food and drink during daylight. There are exceptions made for who are in ill health, pregnant women & travelers. 

One is to make up lost days of fasting at a later time. The time of fasting is from just before sunrise to just after sunset. The breaking of fast is joyous occasion. Sawm during Ramadan or any time is recognized as physically demanding but spiritually rewarding.

###HAJJ: (Pilgrimage)

The pilgrimage season begins in the tenth month, the month following Ramadan, and lasts through the middle of twelfth month, Dhu al-Hijja. This fifth pillar requires all Muslims who are physically and financially capable to make a pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca at least once during their lives. 

The actual rites and prayers of the Hajj take place at the sacred Kaaba in Mecca and at nearby locations. 

Muslims associate the origin of the Hajj and the founding of the Kaaba with the prophet Abraham. At least two million Muslims perform Hajj each year.

###JIHAD: (Striving)

Jihad is not one of the pillars of Islam; but it is a duty in one form or another. The most common mistake about Jihad is to call it a 'Holy War.' The general meaning of the term is "striving for moral and religious perfection." 

The broader meaning of the term Jihad encompasses one's life and community. 

Jihad is the constant struggle of striving to remain on the path of Islam by observing the above five pillars of Islam is Jihad. One who strives is Mujahid.

Being a Mujahid, a striver for moral and religious perfection, involves numerous forms of public and private devotion that characterizes the 'practice' of Islam. This includes respecting the dietary laws against eating pork and drinking alcohol, respecting parents and elders, helping to provide for close relatives and kinfolk, and giving to the poor and disadvantaged. Sins, like theft, murder, fornication, adultery, lying, cheating, false accusation or testifying are strictly forbidden by Shari'a (Islamic Law).

In technical sense, Islam means 'the practice of the religious and social duties' outlined above.

###IMAN: (Tenets of Faith) 

The doctrinal structure of Islam (Iman)can be divided in six parts. Islam requires belief in the following:

1.	God and His Attributes
2.	Prophets
3.	Angels
4.	Sacred Books
5.	The Judgement Day
6.	Predestination
