**Test of Basic Bible Knowledge 4**

**Test of Basic Bible Knowledge**

The following test questions deal with many of the Bible topics which
are considered basic to the Christian Way of Life. Doctrines are not
called “basic” because they are simple to learn, trivial, or “baby
food”, even though they are the most appropriate topics for new
Christians to learn. Rather, basic doctrines are those which are
fundamental to the Christian Way of Life and spiritual growth and which
are prerequisites to the study of advanced concepts of the Bible, just
as in mathematics one studies the basic subjects of algebra,
trigonometry, and calculus to provide the basis for advanced studies in
engineering, physics, medicine, and many other sciences.

Scoring: For each question, decide whether you could give a good answer.
Give yourself **one point for each question** you are certain you could
explain completely and correctly to another person.

You don’t have to write out answers, although the questions do give a
good long-term study outline to follow.

**Note: there is no answer key for this “test”. It is provided as a
method for self-assessment in your knowledge of Bible truth.**

There are documents in the Grace Notes Topics Library which can help you
with your studies of these concepts.

Your score indicates the following ( the numbers are quite arbitrary, of
course):

**75 to 100** – More than a “passing” grade. Indicates you have a good
basic foundation and are ready to study advanced topics. You have
probably spent at least 1,000 hours in organized study to reach this
level. Your personal witnessing and other exercise of spiritual gifts is
well supported by your understanding of God’s Person and Plan. This
score would be the minimum expected of anyone going into Christian work
as a vocation, such as evangelistic, missionary, or mission support
work. This score would also be considered a prerequisite for those
entering seminary to prepare for the pastorate.

**50 to 74** - Indicates good progress in basics and that you have been
serious in your desire to learn God’s Word to this point. Consider
increasing the time spent in attending class and studying. Ask your
pastor to suggest doctrinal materials or tape studies to supplement
classes. You will need another 200 to 400 hours of study to score at the
next level, roughly one hour per day for a year, but you can do it more
quickly if you put yourself into a crash program.

**25 to 49** - Indicates some progress in basics. If you’re over 18,
you’re going to have to put yourself into crash program mode to learn
the fundamentals - two or more hours per day of directed, organized
study, using any doctrinal classes, tapes, materials that you can find.
Progress towards Christian maturity requires consistency, hard work, and
dedication.

**0 to 24** - “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceeds out of the mouth of God.” While you did not need much knowledge
of God or the Bible to be saved, you will need a lot of information from
the Word of God about how to think and function as a productive
Christian. At least 1,000 hours of work will be required to “pass”, but
the eternal significance of the project makes the labor the most
rewarding a person can undertake.
