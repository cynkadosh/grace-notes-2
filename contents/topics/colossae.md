Colossae

COLOSSAE

In the Greek the word is KOLOSSAI, and is defined as “punishment.” The
city was situated on the Lycus River in Phrygia. From its inception, the
city was important according to Herodotus and Xenophon. Xerxes halted at
Colossae in 481 BC. And Cyrus the Younger passed through it in 401 BC.

It is apparent that the Apostle Paul never visited Colossae in person.
The church’s place there was due to Epaphras and Timothy, according to
Colossians 1:17, and the church in Colossae was located in the home of
Philemon, and Epaphras was the Pastor. Documentation that a church was
established in Colossae is found in Colossians 4:12,13; Revelation 1:11;
3:14.

Colossae was the home of many Jews, and the major industry in Colossae
revolved around collossinus, a type of wool which was purple in color.
The religious trend in the city was Gnosticism, and it was this problem
that prompted the writing of the Colossians Epistle by the Apostle Paul.

In the 7th and 8th centuries Colossae was occupied by the Saracens, who
were a North Arabian Muslim tribe. In the 12th century, the Turks
destroyed the city. The ruins of the city have been excavated. During
the Middle Ages the city was known as Chonae and is presently called
Chonas.

Phrygia was called Asia Minor by the Romans. For purposes of
administration the Romans divided Phrygia into two parts: the
northeastern portion to the Galatian Province, the western part to the
Province of Asia. Under the Romans, grapes were cultivated extensively
in the area, and Phrygian marble was quarried. And from this area
originated the ‘Phrygian Cap,’ which was a cloth head-covering adopted
by freed-slaves during Roman rule; it was a symbol of emancipation.
