**Jesus Christ has enemies**

There are those who are merely negative toward Christ but who are not
otherwise pursuing an active hate campaign against Him.

At the other extreme are Satan himself and his force of fallen angels
who wage a continuous active campaign to discredit the Lord and to bring
down His kingdom.

Each Christian was at one time an enemy of Christ. Romans 5:6-11 points
out that we were reconciled to God while we were still enemies of
Christ.

**Every Christian has enemies.**

These range from those who merely do not like us to those who actively
try to harm us.

Every Christian is “in Christ” and is a member of the family of God.
Therefore, enmity toward a child of God is enmity toward God Himself.

God wants every human being to become a believer in Christ and join His
family. So it is the paramount duty of Christians to manifest the proper
attitude toward their personal enemies, in order to make their
repentance and reconciliation with God the Father as easy as possible. 2
Cor. 5:17-21

To give us guidelines about the proper attitude we are to maintain
toward our enemies, the Word of God makes numerous comments on the
subject. The following are some representative Bible statements and
references.

**The Bible commands believers to love all people.**

Prov. 17:9; Matt. 7:1-5; Rom. 15:1; Gal. 6:1; 1 Pet. 4:8.

**Lack of love for others is sinful.**

Isa. 29:20,21; Acts 28:4; 1 Tim. 6:4

**Bible examples of sinful vindictiveness.**

**A Christian has a duty to his enemies.**

Exod. 23:4,5; Prov. 24:17; 25:21,22; Matt. 5:44; Rom. 12:20

**A Christian is forbidden to retaliate against his enemies.**

Lev. 19:18; Prov. 20:22; 24:29; Rom. 12:17-21; 1 Pet. 3:9

**Christians are commanded to be merciful to others.**

**Bible examples of a mature attitude of forgiveness.**

Gen. 45:15; Acts 7:60

**Vindictiveness, lack of mercy, lack of love, judging, revenge, and
retaliation are condemned in the Word of God because such are not
compatible with Grace.**

A Christian is supposed to be a conduit of Grace to other people. Out of
his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water…
