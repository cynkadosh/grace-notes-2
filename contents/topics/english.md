History”, by Joseph M. Williams.

The Indo-European Family of Languages

Our English vocabulary is not something to be studied in isolation but
is related in one way or another to many of the other languages of the
world. The proper beginning for us, therefore, is to view the place of
English in perspective, amid the many tongues of mankind.

Those students who have studied German undoubtedly have noticed a
remarkable similarity between that language and their own. The German
word *Milch* is very close in sound to the English *milk*; likewise, the
German *Wasser* and English *water*, *Brot*and *bread*, *Fleisch*and
*flesh* closely resemble each other, not to mention a great many
additional examples. Perhaps we can see this similarity best if we place
side by side in systematic form the words for *mother*, *father*, and
*brother*, as they appear in various tongues.

<td align="left"><p>broder</p></td>

</tbody>

While the spelling of these words makes their similarities obvious, we
would be even more struck by the likeness if we heard them pronounced.
For instance, a German “v” (as in *Vater*) sounds the same as an English
“f”; also, a brief consideration of one’s own speech will show that the
sounds represented by “t,” “th,” and “d” are closely related.

Now at first glance we might conclude that the similarities among these
languages are due to borrowing, that because these languages are spoken
by people living relatively close to one another, such words were
adopted from one of the languages by the others. This is not the case,
however, as we shall see later. For one thing, there is usually no need
for languages to borrow such simple, fundamental words.

If we extend the table to cover a wider area, we shall find the same
similarity, though not to so great a degree.

\* There are some gaps and irregularities in this pattern; the Spanish
for brother is *hermano*, related to English *germane*, while the Greek
*phrater* means “member of a clan” (originally, “of a brotherhood”).

We have said that the similarities between these languages was not to be
explained in terms of borrowing. The cause of their resemblance lies
rather in the fact that they are descendants of a single parent
language. Thus, most of the major languages of Europe, and some of the
languages of Asia, belong to one family knows as the Indo-European
family of languages. (There are exceptions like Finnish and Hungarian,
which belong to the Ural-Altaic family of languages.)

The original Indo-European parent language became extinct long before
written records existed. It was spoken by a prehistoric people whose
homeland was somewhere in Eastern Europe. The location of their origin,
however, remains an unsolved problem. Sometime between 3000 and 2000 BC
this primitive people, still living in the Stone Age, began a series of
migrations. During the centuries that followed, successive waves of
Indo-Europeans moved westward into Europe and southward into Persia and
India, and the language of these invaders for all practical purposes
obliterated the languages of the earlier inhabitants, in much the same
way that, in the United States, English has superseded the languages of
the American Indians.

Possibly the only survivor of the pre-Indo-European tongues of Europe is
Basque, spoken in a mountainous corner of Spain, where the original
inhabitants were able to maintain their way of life against the
invaders.

But language is constantly changing, and as the various groups of
Into-Europeans became isolated from one another in the vast tracts of
Europe and Asia, the language of each group began to evolve in its own
peculiar fashion. Eventually a number of distinct dialects arose, and in
the course of centuries there was no long one common tongue, but a
series of completely different languages, each of which in turn produced
still more numerous descendants, and so on, until the present multitude
of languages in Europe and Southwest Asia emerged. In diagrammatic form,
the relationship of the Indo-European languages resembles a family tree,
some branches having died out, others having given rise to many
descendants. The modern descendants of the common Indo-European parent
may be divided into eight principal groups or branches. Four of these
belong to the Western or *Centum* subfamily, and the other four belong
to the Eastern or *Satem* subfamily. (This classification is made on the
basis of the word for “hundred” in the various languages, whether it
more nearly approximates the Latin *centum* or the Zend *satem*.)

Teutonic

We should perhaps consider the Teutonic branch first, for to it belongs
English. The primitive Teutonic, which antedates the earliest written
records, eventually came to be divided geographically into three groups
of languages, East, North, and West. The East Teutonic languages did not
survive into modern times, but we know their principal representative,
Gothic, from early translations of the New Testament into that language.
The language of the Vandals, the barbarian raiders who sacked Rome in
455 AD, also belonged to this group. The North Teutonic languages are
spoken today in the Scandinavian countries, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and
Iceland. West Teutonic is represented principally by modern German,
Dutch, Flemish, and English.

Italic

When Rome was only a small village of rude huts on the banks of the
Tiber, there were several Italic languages having equal status with
Latin; but, as Rome achieved a dominant position in the ancient world,
these disappeared, and Latin alone remained. The modern descendants of
Latin, usually called Romance languages, show by their geographical
distribution something of the extent of the Roman Empire. In France and
Spain the Roman conquest resulted in the complete displacement of the
earlier languages by Latin. So today French, Spanish, and Portuguese, as
well as Italian, are classed as Romance languages. Far to the east,
Romanian is likewise a descendant of the language of Roman colonists and
soldiers.

Hellenic

The Hellenic branch of the Indo-European family is today represented by
modern Greek, which is the descendant of the classical Greek of Plato
and Aristotle and the common Greek dialect of the eastern Mediterranean
area in which the New Testament was written.

Celtic

More than two thousand years ago the Celtic languages were spoken
throughout a wide area of western Europe, generally comprising Gaul
(France), part of Spain, and Great Britain. But as we have seen, after
the Roman conquest, Latin replaced the Celtic languages on the
Continent. And, as we shall see later, Teutonic Anglo-Saxon largely
replaced the Celtic speech in Britain. In sections of the British Isles
which were difficult for the invaders to reach, however, Celtic
languages still exist, notably in Ireland and Wales.

Balto-Slavic

The Slavic languages are spoken in Russia, on the Balkan Peninsula in
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and in Poland and Czechoslovakia.

The Baltic groups is today of far less importance. It comprises mainly
Lithuanian and Latvian (or Lettish), the languages of two of the Baltic
States forcibly absorbed by the Soviet Union and 1940, subsequently
becoming independent nations with the breakup of the USSR.

Indo-Iranian

The oldest literary works in any Indo-European language are written in
an Indian language, Sanskrit. As early as 1500 BC a number of very
beautiful sacred books were composed in this language. Because of its
antiquity and therefore closer resemblance to its Indo-European parent,
Sanskrit is of great interest to linguists; only when European scholars
became familiar with it did they realize fully the common origin of the
many languages which we have been discussing. Sanskrit, however, is no
longer spoken, but like Latin, it has become a learned language.

From early Indian dialects called Prakrits existing at the same time as
Sanskrit ultimately came many of the languages of present day India and
Pakistan, such as Hindi, Bengali, and Nepali. Romany, the language of
the Gypsies, likewise belongs to this group, although the Gypsies have
wandered widely throughout Europe and even America; but their homeland
was long ago in the northwestern part of India.

Closely related to the Indic group is the Iranian. Here is to be found
the language of Iran (Persia). Modern Persian (Farsi) contains a great
many Arabic elements, but it is nevertheless considered Indo-European.
Between India and Iran is the small nation of Afghanistan, where
likewise an Iranian language is spoken.

Armenian

Modern Armenian, the sole member of this group, is a language native to
a small area east of the Black Sea, partly in Turkey and partly in
Russia.

Albanian

The only surviving representative of the Albanian branch is Modern
Albanian, spoken in a small nation just north of Greece.

Because all of these languages have come from a common ancestor, they
are called cognate languages, and the similarities between them, which
are not confined merely to vocabulary but include elements of grammar as
well, might be compared to the physical similarities which between
brothers and sisters, or between cousins.

We must remember, however, that the Indo-European is only one of a
number of language families throughout the world. Universal agreement
has not been reached as to the exact extent of many of these families.
The following is a list of some of the more important language families,
together with representative languages.

**Semitic**: Hebrew, Arabic, Syrian, Ethiopic, Phoenician (extinct)

**Hamitic**: the ancient Egyptian of the Pharaohs, Berber (or Libyan)

**Indo-Chinese**: Chinese, Burmese, Siamese, Tibetan

**Ural-Altaic**: Mongolian, Finnish, Estonian, Turkish, Magyar
(Hungarian)

**Dravidian**: the languages of southern India and Ceylon.

**Malay-Polynesian**: the languages of the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia,
the Philippines, and many of the Pacific islands, including Hawaii.

**African Negro**

**Japanese and Korean**

**American Indian**

Between the various families no definite natural relationship has been
established. Thus, while English and Greek can be traced back to a
common ancestor, and are cognate languages, this is not true of, say,
English and Hebrew, or Chinese and Turkish.

The Background of English Vocabulary

Descent from a common ancestor is not the only type of relationship
between languages. A relationship which is more obvious and which has
greatly influenced the vocabulary of our languages is that which has
come about through borrowing; and to see the effect o this, we should
know something of the history of the English language.

During the Stone and early Bronze Ages, the British Isles were inhabited
by a non-Indo-European race, about which next to nothing is known.
Around 1000 BC, however, the Celts began to arrive in Britain and to
conquer the prehistoric inhabitants, eventually completely wiping out
their language. Thus, for some centuries, the languages of the British
Isles were of the Celtic group, and a few of their descendants, Welsh
and Irish, for instance, are spoken today.

In the first century AD, the Romans began the conquest of Britain, and
for the next several hundred years were in control of most of it.
Romanization was proceeding on the island in much the same fashion as on
the Continent, when the Roman occupation was cut short by the withdrawal
of the legions, which were sent to buttress the tottering Roman Empire
against the onslaughts of the eastern barbarians. The language of the
British Celts, therefore, was never completely replaced by Latin.

But something did happen to the Celtic languages of Britain, for it has
already been pointed out that English is a Teutonic language. In the
5<sup>th</sup> century, after the Roman troops had been withdrawn, the
Celts, having been exposed for some time to the softening effects of
civilization, found themselves unable to resist the incursions of the
fierce northern tribes, which had never been subdued by the Romans. The
Celtic leaders sought the aid of certain Germanic peoples living on the
Continent to help them in their struggle. The Germans, however, found
the island so much to their liking that they decided to remain, and in
fact they conquered for themselves most of what is now England. These
Teutonic tribes were known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes; their
language is called Anglo-Saxon, and it became the basis of modern
English. As a matter of fact, the English language took its name from
that of one of the tribes.

From the very first, however, Anglo-Saxon or Old English was subjected
to outside influences. Even before the Angles and Saxons came to
Britain, they had come in contact with Roman civilization. For a time
large parts of Germany were under Roman Domination, and from the Roman
soldiers and the inevitable traders who traveled in their wake, the
languages of the Teutonic tribes received a large number of Latin words.
These words generally indicate the new products and concepts which were
acquired from contact with a higher civilization. thus, when they
arrived in England, the Anglo-Saxons already had borrowed such words as
*straet* (from Latin *via strata*, “paved road”), which became *street*
in modern English. Likewise, for example, came the words *ciese*
(cheese), *win* (wine), *cuppe*(cup), and *pund* (pound).

Old English Period (450 to 1150)

One the Anglo-Saxons were in Britain, contact with the earlier
inhabitants brought some Celtic words, mostly place names like *Kent*
and *London* into Old English. Then, too, some words from Latin and
Greek, such as *altar*, *candle*, and *priest*, were introduced during
this period by Christian missionaries sent from Rome.

Beginning in the 8<sup>th</sup> century, England was subjected to
repeated invasions by Danish marauders, many of whom settled in the
areas of Britain which they had conquered. Despite the valiant efforts
of English leaders, like King Alfred the Great, the invaders could not
be dislodged, but continued to live side by side with the Anglo-Saxons.
The Danes were eventually assimilated, and their language has likewise
left its mark upon English.

Middle English Period (1150 to 1500)

The greatest event in the shaping of the English language, however, was
the Norman Conquest. in 1066, William of Normandy defeated King Harold
at the Battle of Hastings and became rule of England. The Anglo-Saxon
nobles were replaced by a French-speaking aristocracy who regarded
themselves as primarily Frenchmen, and who looked upon England as an
occupied territory. Norman-French became the official language of the
country, the language of law courts, the schools, and the army.

The such a situation, the speech of the conquerors was bound to exert an
influence upon English. Yet English remained as the language of the
masses and kept it basically Teutonic structure. For a time,
Norman-French, spoken by the nobles, and English, spoken by the lower
classes, existed side by side in the conquered land, without affecting
each other as much as is often supposed.

Around 1200, the Norman rulers of England lost many of their holdings on
the Continent, including Normandy, and they henceforth began to regard
themselves as Englishmen rather than as Frenchmen. By 1500, English has
reasserted itself, but is was an English far different from the language
of the Angles and Saxons. In the preceding three centuries many
French-speaking aristocrats, as they learned English, had automatically
introduced many French words into their speech when the could not
remember the new language, of when the English synonym had been
forgotten through disuse. Many who spoke English as a native language
had learned French, not at this time the Norman-French of their early
conquerors, but Parisian French, which had become the cultural and
commercial language of Europe.

Since French was more polished than their own language, which had
declined somewhat in the centuries when it was use mainly by the
uneducated classes, they naturally borrowed French words to make up
deficiencies in their native tongue. Often both the French word and its
English equivalent were kept, sometimes with varying shades of meaning,
and this has tended to make English vocabulary rich and varied. Thus we
have both “begin,” which is native English, and “commence,” which is of
French origin, as well as the following examples: “sin” and “crime”,
“wretched” and “miserable”, “shun” and “avoid”.

During the centuries when the distinction between Frenchman and
Englishman was disappearing in England, the English vocabulary was
enriched by the addition of thousands of French words. The language of
this period is called Middle English, and it reached its fullest
development in the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer. Notable also during the
14<sup>th</sup> century in England was the translation of the Bible into
English by John Wycliffe.

Modern English Period (1500 to present)

By 1500, a new force had begun to exert itself on the English language,
this time the result of an intellectual movement rather than of a
military conquest. The movement was the Renaissance or Revival of
Learning, which was marked by the rapid advance of the sciences, a
renewal of interest in the Greek and Roman classics, the rise of
nationalism, and by such events as the Protestant Reformation, the
invention of the printing press, and the discovery of the New World.

The growth of national consciousness brought with it a desire on the
part of Englishmen and Frenchmen and Italians and others to write books
in their native tongues rather than in Latin, which had been the
universal language of learned men throughout the Middle Ages. Many
English writers, however, felt that their own language was still not
sufficiently developed to meet the demands of the new learning;
therefore, to remedy what they considered deficiencies in vocabulary,
they borrowed wholesale from Latin, which most of them knew almost as
well as English. Further, the revival of interest in the ancient
classics brought with it a flood of new ideas, especially from Greece;
and when a new concept is imported from another culture, there is a
strong tendency to import the word that denotes the concept as well.

The additions to English from Greek and Latin entered English during or
after the Renaissance. Not only were words borrowed in great numbers
directly from the pages of Greek and Roman authors, but countless new
words were also coined, by combining elements from the classical
languages. In fact, the practice of using Greek and Latin as the basis
for new scientific terms is one that still continues.

Thus we have seen, in outline, the major forces which have shaped
English vocabulary. But any contact with foreign nations brings with it
new additions; and English, perhaps because of its conglomerate
background, has shown a greater tendency to borrow than most languages.
The sources of its words are, therefore, from the whole world, often
reflecting the great extent of English based commerce and colonization.

The modern European languages, especially those of France, with its
leadership in cooking and fashion, and Italy, with its preeminence in
the arts, have continued to supply us with a store of words. From the
Near East, Persian (Farsi), for instance, has given to English such
common terms as “check”, “divan”, “pajamas”, and “tiger”. Arabic has
supplied “cotton”, “admiral”, “syrup”, etc. In the Middle Ages, Arabian
science was considerably in advance of the European; a number of our
early scientific terms consequently came to use from the East. Many of
these, “algebra”, “alcohol”, and “alkali”, for example, can be
recognized from the fact that they begin with “al-“, the Arabic definite
article.

From the languages of India, long ruled by the British, have come
“punch”, “bungalow”, “loot”, “thug”, and “dungaree.” The Far East has
produced fewer loan words, yet the Chinese has given “tea”, “typhoon”,
and “catsup”, while Japan has supplied “tycoon” and “kimono”. From
Malayan have come “bamboo” and “bantam”. The islands of the Pacific have
given us “tattoo”, “taboo”, and “hula”.

The borrowings by English in the New World remind us of the different
cultures with which the colonists and pioneers came in contact. English
has absorbed words from American Indian languages, such as “caucus”,
“raccoon”, “hickory”, and “skunk”. Some words came from the French in
America; “prairie” and “butte” testify to the extensive early French
exploration. “Levee”, “picayune”, and “bayou” came from the French
settlements in Louisiana. The Dutch colonists in New York added “boss”,
“cookie”, “stoop”, and “scow”. Later, from the Spanish-speaking culture
of the Southwest English acquired words like “ranch”, “canyon”,
“stampede”, and “mustang”. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, immigrants
from various countries added some of their native stock words, such as
“pretzel”, “hamburger”, and “delicatessen” from the German.

Thus we have seen something of the composite nature of English, and the
many sources of its words. No other important language possesses such a
complexity and variety of vocabulary; and this richness, while it has
increased the difficulty of learning English, has made it an extremely
flexible instrument.
