##### Introduction


The word apostle or **apostolos** is from the Greek, meaning an
ambassador; one who is sent; a delegated authority. The word was used
for high ranking naval officers in classical Greek times. An apostle of
Jesus Christ was the highest ranking official in the local churches, 1
Cor. 12:28.

Apostles of Jesus Christ were appointed by God the Father for the
purpose of establishing churches and spreading new truth, Eph. 3:1‑10.
There were both the spiritual gift and office of apostleship. The
spiritual gift was the divine enabling to function as an apostle, Eph.
4:11, 1 Cor. 12:28, 29. The office of apostleship was the authority to
function as an apostle, Rom. 1:5, Acts 1:25, Gal. 2:8.

Some of the uses of **apostolos** outside of the Bible are:

-   In the classical Greek period (4th and 5th centuries B.C.),
    apostolos was used by Lysias and Demosthenes to refer to the
    commander of a naval expedition. When the Athenians went to war,
    there was a number of men qualified to command the fleet. One of
    these was elected by lot and sent to the fleet to command it. He was
    called apostolos.

-   During the Hellenistic period (323 B.C. and following) apostolos was
    used to refer to a person commissioned and authorized by one of the
    gods.

-   In the Papyri of the koine period apostolos was used to refer to a
    civil agent sent to transact official business.

In the New Testament, the apostles of Jesus Christ fall into two
classes:

-   The apostles of Jesus Christ to Israel, Luke 6:12‑16. These were
    appointed by Jesus Christ according to the will of God the Father.
    These men were authorized to announce to Israel that their Messiah
    was present; and they were endowed with miraculous powers, Luke 9:1,
    2.

-   The apostles of Jesus Christ to the church. These included the
    eleven disciples (Acts 1:26), Paul (Rom. 1:1, etc.), James the
    brother of Christ (Gal. 1:19) and Barnabas (Acts 14:14).

##### The Qualifications of an Apostle


An apostle had to have the spiritual gift of apostleship. The gift was
provided by Jesus Christ after His ascension into heaven, Eph. 4:8‑11.
The gift was imparted by the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, 1 Cor.
12:11; Acts 2.

The apostle received his gift and office by the sovereign decision of
God the Father, 1 Cor. 1:1; 12:18; Eph. 1:1; Col. 1:1.

The apostle had to have been an eyewitness of the resurrected Lord, Acts
1:22; 1 Cor. 9:1.

##### The Credentials of an Apostle


An apostle was endowed with miraculous powers of miracles, Heb. 2:4; 2
Cor. 12:12.

An apostle had success in evangelism, 2 Cor. 3:1‑3; Gal. 2:7‑9.

An apostle had the capacity to suffer patiently, 2 Cor. 12:12.

##### The Function of an Apostle


Apostles received and communicated new revelation, Eph. 3:2-6.

Apostles communicated the gospel effectively and people accepted Christ
in response to their preaching, 1 Cor. 9:1; Gal. 2:7‑9.

Apostles helped organize local churches and appointed officers, Acts
14:23; Tit. 1:5.

Apostles trained new believers in doctrine, 1 Thess. 1:5 to 2:12.

Apostles had the authority to administer discipline to believers, Acts
5:1‑10; 1 Tim. 1:20; 1 Cor. 4:21; 2 Cor. 13:2.

The apostle had authority over all local churches because he was the
channel of New Testament revelation. Since the time of the apostles, no
one has been given authority over more than one local church.

The apostle Paul was the most grace oriented apostle. He realized that
he was the least deserving to be an apostle, 1 Cor. 15:9. He was the
most productive because of grace, 1 Cor. 15:10. There were false
apostles who communicated false information, 2 Cor. 11:13; Rev. 2:2.
