Introduction
============

Eph. 4:15,16 provides a concise description of a mature, productive
local church.

-   "Speaking the truth in love,

-   we are to grow up in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even
    Christ,

-   from whom the whole body,

-   being fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies,

-   according to the proper working of each individual part,

-   causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in
    love."

The mature local church is made up of mature believers who work together
to fulfill the Plan of God and the Christian mission.

The Local Church’s Mission
==========================

The local church’s mission includes the following activities:

**Worship as a local assembly** - “forsake not the assembling of
yourselves together”

**Evangelism** - the winning of people to the Christian faith. “He that
winneth souls is wise…”

**Edification** - “Feed the church of God …” “Feed the flock”

**Training** - “Study to show yourselves approved unto God, a workman …”

**Service** - Attention to the details of encouragement and support of
everyone in the body of Christ.

The local church’s mandate, then, is to maintain an organizational
structure for the purpose of meeting God’s requirements for worship,
evangelism, edification, and the development of skilled workers to carry
out the work associated with the stated mission.

We are to worship “in Spirit and in truth”. The work of the local church
must be carried out in the presence of the Holy Spirit, with His
control, and through His total ministry of teaching, convicting, and
controlling. The work of the local church must center in and deal
exclusively with the Bible, the Word of God. The revealed Word of God,
the “mind of Christ” is the only effective tool for learning what God’s
will is and carrying it out.

Therefore, the main daily work of the pastor and members of a local
church is to provide a maximum of high quality Bible teaching, in
sufficient quantity to allow believers to make rapid progress in the
Christian Way of Life. The main activity of the local church, apart from
prayer and worship, is Bible teaching

To meet the teaching requirements of the church’s mission, the following
are required:

1.  A well-defined strategy for providing the teaching needs of the
    church.

2.  A mature set of plans for developing and carrying out a teaching
    program.

3.  Execution of the plans by assigning and employing people to the
    work, setting schedules, and putting the plans in motion

The Church’s Teaching Ministry
==============================

2 Tim. 2:1,2 “You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
Christ Jesus. And the things which you have heard from me in the
presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, who will be
able to teach others also.”

Bible study has four main components:

**Bible Analysis** - exegesis and exposition. The process of dissecting
a passage of Scripture into its component parts (vocabulary, syntax,
grammar) in order to learn as well as possible the meaning
(interpretation) of the passage.

**Topical Development** - categorization. Briefly, the process of
determining the meaning of words and concepts found in a passage of
scripture by searching the whole Bible for clues, explanations, and
illustrations of the subject under study.

**Historical Study** - The process of studying the social history of the
people and cultures in the context of the Bible passage, and the
language history of the text, to learn as much as possible about the
text, as used colloquially in the time in which it was written, and to
learn how the text was applied to the people living in that time and
place.

**Correlation of Categorical Doctrine** – This involves the gathering
together of groups of related doctrinal studies that deal with specific
subject areas of application.

With these things in mind, a local church can design a comprehensive
Bible teaching curriculum which will meet the needs of all age groups as
they grow in Christ. Such a curriculum will contain components such as
the following:

Bible Studies
-------------

Include:

-   Verse by verse expositional studies of books of the Bible

-   Studies of Bible topics regarding salvation, stability in the
    Christian way of life, and spiritual production

-   Survey studies: Old Testament survey, New Testament survey, life of
    Christ, Acts and Life/Epistles of Paul, etc.

Historical Studies
------------------

-   Survey of Ancient History (early times to Byzantine Empire)

-   Survey of Hebrew History (in Bible light)

-   History of major mid-Eastern world powers - Egypt, Assyria, Sumer,
    Babylon, Medo-Persia, Hittites, Greece, Rome

-   History of Judea

-   History of the Jewish religion and practices

-   Detailed history of the period from 100 BC to 100 AD

-   American History (from Christian viewpoint), American and state
    government

-   Law - short courses in “legal research” or “orientation to law and
    the courts”

Studies in Preparation for Teaching
-----------------------------------

-   Biblical languages (Greek, Hebrew, etc.), introductory and advanced.

-   Hermeneutics and exegesis

-   Use of reference materials: concordances (English, Greek, Hebrew);
    Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias; commentaries; systematic
    theology studies

-   Development of expertise in preparing Bible studies

-   English grammar and composition

-   Public speaking

-   Christian literature (non-fiction)

-   Bible lesson development and organization

-   Use of parallel passages

-   How to find and use illustrations

-   How to determine and teach appropriate applications

Such a curriculum is very ambitious and will require several years for
any individual to complete. But when this effort is compared to the
requirements for obtaining a high school diploma or college degre e, the
eternal results to be gained certainly make the work of organization,
teaching, and study worthwhile.
