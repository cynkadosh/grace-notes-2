Christians affect history, from an eternal point of view, only when they
operates within the revealed plan of God. As the believer goes, so goes
the community and the nation to God.

Distortions of truth have caused chaos in the church age ever since the
time of the apostles. A balanced, bona fide approach to the Christian
Way of Life can only be achieved with a thorough understanding of the
plan of God, from the viewpoint of God Himself.

Any Christian believer is either winning or losing in the attempt to
live as a Christian. A believer is either living according to the
revealed plan of God, or is serving “the ruler of this world.” There is
no in-between or middle ground.

There are two types of novice believers.

The **first type** is the person who has recently accepted Christ as
Savior and is making the first tentative steps as a babe in Christ. This
person usually has little information beyond that required to understand
the Gospel message. Nevertheless, with perseverance and hard work, and
with the aid of fellow believers and Bible teachers, the babe in Christ
can make rapid progress toward a useful and productive Christian life.

The **second type** of novice is the person who has lived for one, two,
or more years since salvation without taking advantage of the provisions
the Lord has made for spiritual growth, edification, and production in
the Christian life. This individual is a pitiable creature, showing the
symptoms of spiritual malnutrition, who flounders around knowing that
something is wrong but never able to figure it out. The older novice may
simply be neglecting the Word of God in favor of other pursuits or may,
even as a believer, actually be opposed to Bible teaching. Whatever the
cause, this novice misses the boat entirely.

God the Father’s ardent desire for each of us is that, as His children,
we “grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus
Christ” and that we fulfill the plan of God so carefully laid out in the
Scriptures.

##### Characteristics of the Christian Novice

1.  The Christian novice is born again. A person who is not saved does
    not fall into the novice category. On the other hand, a novice
    believer may have every outward characteristic of an unbeliever, and
    yet be saved. It is important for advanced Christians who want to
    have a ministry of Bible teaching to be able to discern the
    difference.

2.  The novice Christian is almost totally unaware of God’s plan for his
    life. Therefore, for God’s plan he substitutes what he assumes, what
    he thinks, what his own standards dictate to him, what he concludes
    from all this internalizing what surely must be God’s plan for his
    life. Often, the novice concludes that it’s important to have a
    sweet personality, or to adhere to a particular set of taboos, or
    moral do’s and don’ts.

3.  The novice usually attends church and participates. His church
    activities distinguish him from the more frivolous members of
    society who he thinks of as worldly.

4.  The novice Christian often regards the Bible-oriented believer as a
    cultist. He has “never heard that doctrine before”; and he disdains
    the things that don’t match his opinions. The mental block of the
    novice Christian results from arrogant subjectivity, resistance to
    Bible truth, failure to understand the meanings of Bible words, or
    laziness of mentality. In spite of his “sweetness”, this believer is
    often word that an unbeliever in his private life.

5.  The novice believer has never been weaned from the “milk” of the
    Word in order to learn the plan of God. So, for the real substance
    of the Christian life, he substitutes other things, such as emotion,
    feeling saved, having a rosy glow, getting a thrill from the message
    (or illustration). He does not live the Christian life; he is not
    spiritual; he does not study the Bible. He just wants to be sincere
    and try to do his best.

6.  Behind the novice’s façade of sweetness is hypocrisy, hardcore
    self-righteousness, implacability, adverse reaction to anything new
    in doctrine. The average novice believer is highly critical,
    disdains the things he didn’t think of himself. He is not interested
    in a teaching sermon; he wants, in fact, short sermons, pithy
    sermons, sermons that re-emphasize his opinions of the world scene.

7.  The novice believer often loves sharing, however, because he likes
    the sound of his own voice, and because he can express his opinion,
    give his testimony, receive adulation from others.

8.  The novice wants a convenient church and a convenient pastor who
    doesn’t offend anyone; he wants counseling and compliments and to be
    married and buried. Otherwise, he thinks of his pastor as a social
    ornament, someone in the background at gatherings who can be pointed
    out.

9.  The novice Christian is easily led into social action and
    “crusades”. He likes thinking of himself as a world-changer.
    Sometimes he gets into civil disobedience. He wants to straighten
    out everyone who is not in his mutual admiration society – he wants
    to straighten out the government.

10. The novice Christian is “ignorant of God’s righteousness and goes
    about to establish his own righteousness, not submitting himself to
    the righteousness of God.”

The solution, of course, for both the babe in Christ and for the novice
Christian, is to submit to the authority of the Word of God, under the
controlling ministry of the Holy Spirit, through faith and obedience, to
advance toward the goals of conformity to the image of Christ and the
production of the acceptable fruit of gold, silver, and precious stones.
