**The Chronology of the High Priests**

1st high priest – Aaron

2nd – one of Aaron’s sons

At this time, high priests served for life, and the position was usually
passed from father to son.

From the time of Aaron until Solomon the King was 612 years. During this
time there were 13 high priests. Average term – 47 years.

From Solomon until the Babylonian captivity

466 years and 6 months; 18 high priests; average term 26 years.

Josadek was high priest when the captivity began, and he was high priest
during part of the captivity. His son Jesus, was high priest when the
people were allowed to go back to the land.

From the captivity until Antiochus Eupator

415 years; 15 high priests, counting Jesus, son of Josadek, average term
27.6 years.

Antiochus killed Onias, the last of this series, and appointed Joacimus.
Jacimus was descended from Aaron, but he was not the son of Onias.

Jacimus served three years, until his death. No one succeeded him, and
there was no high priest for seven years.

When the Hasmoneans (Maccabees) had defeated the Greeks in war, they
appointed Jonathan to be high priest.

Jonathan was killed by Trypho and was succeeded by his brother, Simon.

Simon was killed by his own son-in-law. and he was succeeded by his son
Hyrcanus.

Hyrcanus was high priest for 30 years; died a natural death, leaving the
succession to Judas Aristobulus.

Judas Aristobulus declared himself king of the Jews and for a short time
had religious and political power. He died, and his brother Alexander
was his heir.

Alexander was high priest and king for 27 years, and just before he
died, he gave his wife, Alexandra, the authority to appoint the next
high priest.

Alexandra gave the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, but she kept the throne
for herself, ruled for nine years, and died.

After her death, Hyrcanus’ brother, another Aristobulus, fought against
him and took over both the kingship and high priesthood. But after a
little more than three years, the Roman legions under Pompey took
Jerusalem by force, put Aristobulus and his children in bondage and sent
them to Rome. Pompey restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus and
appointed him governor. However, he was not allowed to call himself
king.

So Hyrcanus ruled, in addition to his first nine years, another 24
years. Then, the Parthians came across the Euphrates river, fought with
the Romans and with Hyrcanus, took him alive, and made Antigonus, the
son of Aristobulus, king.

When Antigonus had ruled three years and three months, Herod the Great
defeated the Parthians (and Antigonus). The Romans made Herod king, and
he cut off the Hasmonean family from the high priesthood, preferring to
appoint those who were from common families … with one exception.

Herod made another man Aristobulus high priest, to try to win the good
will of the people. Aristobulus was the grandson of the Hyrcanus who had
been captured by the Parthians. But Aristobulus proved to be too
popular, so Herod had him drowned while he was swimming at Jericho.

Herod’s son, Archelaus, also appointed high priests who were relatively
unknown, as did the Romans who were afterwards made rulers or governors
in the land.

There were 28 high priests, in all, during the 107 years from Herod
until 70 AD, when Titus burned the Temple and the City. So the average
was about 3 ½ years per man.
